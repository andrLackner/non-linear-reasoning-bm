# Non-linear Reasoning

This repository contains over 600 benchmarks for first-order theorem
provers in the domain of non-linear reasoning. Most of the benchmarks
in this repository are defined in the theory NIA.

The benchmarks are separated into four different datasets:
1. baseline
2. norm
3. denorm
4. inductive
